# X-Call testing front-end

This front-end was build to try and test the X-Call API.
During my discovery phase, it eventually became too complex than I thought to manage and was replaced by a [simpler no-gui version](https://github.com/Staky-io/xcall-testing-scripts).

You can still play around with it, but it's not maintained anymore and is barely functionnal.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
